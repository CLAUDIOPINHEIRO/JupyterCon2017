### Education - Open Classroom
* Microsoft Cognitive API and Jupyter Python Notebooks showcasing APIS which can be used across curriculum 

* As the pace of global innovation continues to accelerate, the University of Cambridge is evolving engineering & Mathematics curriculum to teach core concepts faster using higher level, open source tools in the public cloud. For example, a Dr Garth Wells has increased learning in an introductory computing class by having students use Microsoft Azure Notebooks, which allows them to spend more time mastering concepts and enhancing problem solving skills and less time on language syntax. This technology switch also gives students anytime, anywhere access to required tools needed to complete assignments, and it facilitates greater collaboration between professors, students, and the larger community. In addition, after Cambridge adopted a public cloud solution, IT infrastructure doesn’t limit the ingenuity of bright minds.
